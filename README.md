Collection of all deliverables and supporting materials for my senior design project.

The project was intended to be an underwater implementation of visual odometry. While an algorithm for visual odometry was proposed, the team was short of time to actually implement this algorithm for underwater purposes. Hence this work would have to be carried forward by a future team.
